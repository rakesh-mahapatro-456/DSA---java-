here, we find the node which is forming a loop and make it point yowards null
steps :
s1 : detect cycle
    a. slow = head
    b.prev = null --> tracks the prev node of fast
    c. while(slow == fast){
        slow -->+1
        prev = fast //prev of fast
        fast -->+1
        slow and fast move by 1 step due to which both of them meet at the point where the last node in the ll is joining again in ll to make a loop i.e they meet lastnode+1 th node in the ll
    }
    d. prev.next = null ; // last node

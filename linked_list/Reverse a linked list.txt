Reverse a Linked list :
i/p : 1->2->3->4->null
o/p : null <-1<-2<-3<-4

there are 4 steps in reversing it 
we require 3 variables named prev,curr,next these are used in order to reverse the link present between these nodes i.e
before : prev ->curr->next
after  : prev <-curr<-next


curr = head
prev = head


while(curr != null){

    step 1 :next = curr.next // next's next to curr
    step 2 :curr.next = prev // curr next to prev actual reversing step
    step 3 :prev = curr // changing prev node after reverse to curr
    step 4 :curr = next // changing curr node after reverse to next

}

it is one the pardigm of programming in which we use classes and objects while coding
classes & objects :
classes - it is a blueprint of an object or it is group of entities/objects with similar properties
objects - entities in the real world or real-world entities

example : pen - a object 

class Room - a class in which group of entities/objects named students are present 
grade,school name,uniform,books,syllabus, are commom properties for student object in the classroom class

classes = attributes/properties + functions (behaviour)
exampe : pen class
pen color,pen tip size, pen prize these all are pen object's properties
changeColor(),changeTipSize() these are the functions/methods which are used to change properties of the pen object
